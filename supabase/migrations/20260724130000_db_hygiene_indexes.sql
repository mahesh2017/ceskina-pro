-- Advisor 0001 + 0005: the existing 2-column pack index only prefixes the
-- 3-column FK (pack_key, pack_version, checksum), so the FK reads uncovered
-- AND the partial index reports unused. Replace it with the exact covering
-- index for the FK.

-- Advisor 0008 (RLS enabled, no policy): these are service-role-only counter
-- tables. RLS-on with no policy is the intended, most-restrictive state — it
-- denies anon/authenticated entirely while service_role bypasses RLS. Document
-- the intent so the informational lint is understood, not "fixed" by adding a
-- client policy that would weaken them.
