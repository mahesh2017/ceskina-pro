-- Anonymous-user hygiene: purge never-linked anonymous accounts that have
-- been idle for 90+ days, so orphaned sync rows don't accumulate forever.

-- Safe for real users: the app is offline-first, so a returning user's local
-- data re-syncs under a fresh anonymous session. Linked accounts
-- (is_anonymous = false) and recently-active anonymous accounts are never
-- touched. Deleting the auth user cascades to that user's sync rows via the
-- ON DELETE CASCADE user_id foreign keys.
